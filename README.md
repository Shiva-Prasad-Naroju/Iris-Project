# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Species Classification with Logistic Regression:

Welcome to the Iris Species Classification project! 
This repository showcases a multi-class classification model built using logistic regression, designed to accurately predict the species of iris flowers based on their morphological features. The project is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview:

This project leverages the classic Iris dataset to build a robust multi-class classification model using logistic regression. The main objective is to provide a simple, accessible interface for users to classify iris species based on input features, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of logistic regression for multi-class problems in a real-world scenario.

## âœ¨ Features:

- Multi-class Classification: Distinguishes between Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica species.

- Streamlit Web App: User-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

- Accuracy: Achieved perfect accuracy, precision, and recall on the test set.

- Interactive Input: Users can input flower features and get instant predictions.
